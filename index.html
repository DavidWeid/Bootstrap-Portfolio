                        I am a University of Central Florida graduate with a bachelor's degree in chemistry currently
                        working
                        as a phlebotomist at BioLife Plasma Services. My during my studies, I focused on biochemistry
                        and
                        medical-related coursework. I enjoy organic chemistry the most, and I love the natural
                        sciences. I am
                        now learning coding through the UCF Bootcamp. My desire to learn and work with technology fuels
                        me
                        to work hard and make the most of every opportunity I can grab. <br /><br />
                        I love playing videogames and even building computers - so far I have built four computers, and
                        each one
                        leaves me feeling pround when I start them up and everything works according to expectations.
                        My favorite
                        game is a MOBA called League of Legends, which I have played longer than any other game. I also
                        love music,
                        with Troye Sivan being my favorite artist and Twenty-One Pilots my favorite band. I recently
                        saw Sivan
                        in concert and plan on seeing Twenty-One Pilots in 2019. <br /><br />
                        Learning coding so far has been an exciting journey. In just the first week I felt like a lot
                        was learned,
                        and I am looking forward to continue learning. The amazing thing about learning is that it is a
                        never
                        ending process, and I can see that the same is true for coding. The course is helpful because
                        it creates
                        a structured learning environment with countless resources available for success. It builds
                        into the
                        fact that working in the real-world is a collaborative process so teamwork is essential. Also
                        essential
                        is the ability to think through problems, evaluate the situation, and find the answer - I will
                        not
                        always know the answer, but as long as I know how to get the answer then things will work out.<br /><br />
